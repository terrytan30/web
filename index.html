    <h2>What it is</h2>
    <p>Undertale is an <a href= "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indie/">indie</a> <!-- adds a clickable hyperlink to a word --> role-playing game by Toby Fox released on September 15th, 2015. The game takes you through multiple different areas with a wide variety in the cast of characters, each with their own interesting characteristics. Unlike normal role-playing games, your different choices can lead to different paths.

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
    Although Undertale's reputation on the internet has gone down because of its questionable fanbase, the game still remains a large impact on both mine and many others' lives. For a game made mainly by one person, the game has seen a lot of success. Millions of copies worldwide has been sold, and many sources rate the game very high. The game itself challenges traditional ideas and presents new ones. For the most part, role-playing games are games that you spend hours and hours playing, repeating the same process over ad over again. However, Undertale is a game that has not only an ending, but also multiple endings. The game is only a couple hours long, but its brilliant cast of characters, storyline and <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpJl5XaLHtLX-pDk4kctGxtF4nq6BIyjg">music</a> can influence many. Many pieces of fanart, music remixes, and even whole other AUs or 'alternate universes'of the game have been created and enjoyed by millions. Although the fandom is not as large as it used to be, the game has a great legacy.
    For me, the music, characters, and the premise of the game has made it my favorite game of all time.
